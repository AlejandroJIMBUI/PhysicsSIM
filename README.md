# Key features:

- Comprehensive visualization of core physics concepts
- Interactive parameter controls for experimental learning
- Computational implementations of theoretical models
- Designed to complement course material

### The simulations demonstrate practical applications of:

- Classical mechanics principles
- Kinematic equations
- Dynamic systems behavior
- Particle physics fundamentals
